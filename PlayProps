. Exact Age via Queue Browsing (requires application consumer)
What it does: Uses a non-destructive “queue browser” to peek the oldest message and read a timestamp (e.g., JMS timestamp or custom publish time).
How it works:
A lightweight consumer connects to the queue and browses the first message without consuming it.
Reads the timestamp, calculates now – timestamp.
Publishes the result as a Prometheus metric.
