Problems with Current Approach

Semantic Mismatch: Counter metrics are designed for rate-based monitoring (e.g., errors per minute), not state tracking. Events like SYSTEM_HA_REDUN_GROUP_NODE_LEFT represent state changes, not rates.
False Resolution: Your Grafana alert resolves based on "no new occurrences" rather than actual state normalization. A node being down for days would show as "resolved" after 1 hour of no new events.
Loss of State Context: You can't determine the current state of the system, only that events occurred in the past.
