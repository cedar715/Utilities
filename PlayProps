Subject: Feature Request: Native "Oldest Message Age" Metric at Queue Level via SEMP v2

Dear Solace Support Team,
Summary
We are requesting a native queue-level attribute in SEMP v2 that provides the age of the oldest spooled message directly, without requiring a call to the /msgs endpoint.
Current Environment

Broker Version: PubSub+ 10.11.1.167
Deployment: 6 HA kits (3 instances each, 18 brokers total)
Queue Count: High volume across the environment
Monitoring Stack: Prometheus + Grafana

Business Requirement
We need to monitor message backlog age across all queues to detect consumer lag, stuck messages, and potential processing issues. Knowing how long the oldest message has been waiting in each queue is critical for our SLA monitoring and alerting.
Current Approach & Challenges
Since no direct "oldest message age" attribute exists at the queue level, we are currently using:
GET /SEMP/v2/monitor/msgVpns/{msgVpnName}/queues/{queueName}/msgs?count=1
This retrieves the oldest message's spooledTime, from which we calculate the age.
However, this approach has significant performance implications:

CPU Impact: Each polling cycle (hourly) causes an 8–10% CPU spike on brokers with large queue counts
Scalability Concerns: The /msgs endpoint is expensive by design and not recommended for frequent polling, yet there is no alternative for this metric
Operational Risk: As our queue count grows, this overhead will increase proportionally

Feature Request
We propose adding a native attribute at the queue object level, such as:
GET /SEMP/v2/monitor/msgVpns/{msgVpnName}/queues/{queueName}
Response:
json{
  "data": {
    "queueName": "example-queue",
    "spooledMsgCount": 15000,
    "oldestMsgId": 123456,
    "oldestMsgAgeSeconds": 3600,   // <-- Requested attribute
    "oldestMsgSpooledTime": 1701234567,  // <-- Alternative: epoch timestamp
    ...
  }
}
Benefits of This Approach

Efficiency: The broker already tracks oldestMsgId internally; exposing its timestamp or calculated age would be a lightweight addition
Reduced Load: Eliminates the need to query the expensive /msgs endpoint for monitoring purposes
Consistency: Aligns with existing queue-level metrics like spooledMsgCount and msgSpoolUsage
Broad Applicability: This is a common monitoring requirement that would benefit the wider Solace user community

Interim Guidance Request
While this feature is being considered, we would appreciate any guidance on:

Alternative approaches to obtain this metric with lower overhead
Recommended polling strategies for environments with high queue counts
Any internal/undocumented attributes that might already provide this information

We are happy to provide additional details about our environment or participate in any beta testing if this feature moves forward.
Thank you for your consideration.
